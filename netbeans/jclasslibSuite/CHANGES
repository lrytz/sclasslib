1.1 (Sat Feb 25 2006)
---------------------

  - Initial synchronization with NetBeans source code editor.
    When the Browse Bytecode action is invoked, appropriate node in the Bytecode
    Browser's tree is selected and opened automatically. Currently methods and
    constructors are supported. Does not work with method descriptors containing
    genererics and with inner classes yet (just General category is opened in
    those cases).
